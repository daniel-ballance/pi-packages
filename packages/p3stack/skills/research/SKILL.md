description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.

Read [child delegation guidance](../poteto-mode/references/host-capabilities.md) before using child delegation.

For substantial research, when child and retrieval tools are available, spawn a bounded child so you can keep working while it reads. For a trivial lookup, or when those tools are unavailable, research directly. Start it with a fresh context window.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** (official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs), not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.
